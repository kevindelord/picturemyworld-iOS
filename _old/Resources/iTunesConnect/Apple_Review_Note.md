## Apple Review Note

Hi there,

This is an open source project, you can find the code here: https://github.com/kevindelord/picturemyworld-iOS
There is no need of an account or anything. 

The app fetches, parses and displays the element of the main HTML page of the travel blog: http://picturemy.world

All images are stored locally to make sure they are not downloaded mutiple times.

I hope it's bug free ;)

Thanks
